# Pedal Solution

**This solution is still WIP, I'm verifing this.**

## How to use

Using Padel to control vim mode.

- while pressed the padel 1, send a "I" to computer and send a ESC key after you released.
- while pressed the padel 2, send a "V" to computer and send a ESC key after you released.

Just like the brake and throttle in the vehicle, you should use right foot (if you haven't lost it) to control it for avoiding press them at same time.
